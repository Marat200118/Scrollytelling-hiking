        <h3>First time</h3>
        <p>First time I experienced hiking, when I was 11, then my parents
          took me to the survival camp, where I was the youngest participant. I was shoked, because I didn't know what
          to do and how to survive in the wild nature.
          We slept in the tents, cooked food on the fire, and did a lot of other interesting things. It was amazing!
        </p>

      <div class="history-article">
        <h3>Start of the journey</h3>
        <p>After the first time, I realised, that I like to accept the challenges and to be in the wild nature. So, I
          started to participate in the survival camp each year
          and I was prepairing seriously. It was the great atmosphere, which I will never forget.

        <h3>Years of practicing</h3>
        <p>I participated in a survival camp for 5 years, I was a leader among other guys, so after 5 years the camp
          director invited me to work and share my experience as an Instructor!<br>
          So, It turned to be my summer job, which I really enjoyed.

        <h3>Present</h3>
        <p>For now, I can say, that I am a professional hiker, I have a lot of experience, and know how to survive in
          the wild nature. I am still working in a same camp as a Deputy of the director, teaching guys how to not only
          survive, but also how to make
          a basic comfort in wild nature
