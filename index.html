        <h3>First time</h3>
        <p>First time I went hiking was in 2017, when I was studying in university. <br> It was a trip to the mountains
          in the south of Kazakhstan. <br> I was so excited, because it was my first time in the mountains. <br> I
          remember, that I was so tired, but it was worth it. <br> I saw the most beautiful view in my life. <br> And
          since that time I fell in love with hiking.
