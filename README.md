# Scrollytelling Project

## Project Overview
This project is an immersive personal story told through the scrollytelling technique. It aims to captivate users by transforming a standard web page into an interactive experience that responds to scrolling. The story unfolds as the user scrolls through the page, with animations and content changes that engage and hold the user's attention.

### Story Theme
The story is a personal narrative centered around my hobby of hiking. It details my journey from the first encounter with hiking in a survival camp to becoming an experienced hiker and instructor. The story is conveyed using various animation techniques to create a truly interactive scrollytelling experience.

## Technical Stack
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code
- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries**: GSAP & ScrollTrigger plugin
- **Deployment**: Project is deployed online for mobile-optimized viewing

## Features
- **Scroll-Activated Animations**: Elements and sections come alive as the user scrolls through the narrative.
- **Video Integration**: Videos are controlled by scrolling, allowing users to "scrub" through as they read.
- **Interactive Maps**: Mapbox integration to illustrate various hiking locations and future adventure plans.
